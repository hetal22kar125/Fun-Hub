# This is a small C++ project I created to practice and improve my programming skills. 
# It helped me strengthen my understanding of basic concepts and problem-solving techniques.

# Fun-Hub
A multi game experience 

# Features
1.Tic-Tac-Toe (two players, console-based)
2.Number Guessing (random number between 1–100)
3.Math Puzzle (random +, -, * problems with score tracking)
4.8-Puzzle (display scaffold — movement handling TODO)

# Requirements
A C++ compiler (g++, clang++)
Standard C++ library (no external dependencies)

# How to play (controls)

# Main menu
Choose the number for the game (1–4), or 5 to exit.
